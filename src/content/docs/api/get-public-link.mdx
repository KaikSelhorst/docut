# Get Public Link

Access a shortened link to get redirected to the original URL. This endpoint also tracks click analytics.

## Endpoint

```
GET /api/link/{id}
```

## Authentication

**No authentication required** - this is a public endpoint.

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                                 |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `id`      | string | Yes      | The unique identifier of the shortened link |

## Response

### Success Response (302 Redirect)

The API will redirect you to the original URL with appropriate HTTP status codes:

- **302 Found** - Temporary redirect to the original URL
- **301 Moved Permanently** - Permanent redirect (for SEO purposes)

### Error Responses

#### 404 Not Found

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Link not found"
  }
}
```

This occurs when:

- The link ID doesn't exist
- The link has expired
- The link has been deleted

## Example Usage

### Browser

Simply navigate to the shortened URL in your browser:

```
https://your-domain.com/abc123def
```

The browser will automatically redirect to the original URL.

```javascript
// In a browser environment, simply navigate to the URL
window.location.href = "https://your-domain.com/abc123def";

// For programmatic access (e.g., in Node.js)
const response = await fetch("https://your-domain.com/api/link/abc123def", {
  redirect: "manual", // Don't follow redirects automatically
});

if (response.status === 302) {
  const redirectUrl = response.headers.get("Location");
  console.log("Redirect to:", redirectUrl);
} else if (response.status === 404) {
  console.log("Link not found");
}
```

## Analytics Tracking

When a link is accessed, the following information is automatically tracked:

### Click Data

| Field | Description
| --- | --- |
| IP Address | For geographic analysis 
| User Agent | For browser and device detection 
| Referrer | The page that linked to the shortened URL 
| Timestamp | When the click occurred 
| Geographic Data | Country and city (if available) 

### Unique Visitor Detection

- Visitors are considered unique based on IP address
- A visitor is considered unique if they haven't clicked the same link in the last 24 hours
- This helps distinguish between unique visitors and repeat clicks

## SEO Considerations

### Meta Tags

If SEO metadata was provided when creating the link, it will be included in the redirect page:

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Custom Page Title" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Custom page description for SEO" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://original-url.com" />
```

### Search Engine Optimization

- Links use **302 redirects** by default for temporary redirects
- This prevents search engines from indexing the shortened URL
- The original URL's SEO value is preserved

## Error Handling

### Link Not Found (404)

```javascript
try {
  const response = await fetch("https://your-domain.com/api/link/invalid-id");
  if (response.status === 404) {
    console.log("Link not found or expired");
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Network error:", error);
}
```

### Expired Links

```javascript
// Check if a link is still valid before using it
const checkLink = async (linkId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://your-domain.com/api/link/${linkId}`, {
    method: "HEAD", // Use HEAD request to check without following redirect
  });

  if (response.status === 404) {
    return { valid: false, reason: "Link not found or expired" };
  } else if (response.status === 302) {
    return { valid: true, redirectUrl: response.headers.get("Location") };
  }
};
```

## Best Practices

### For Link Creators

1. **Test your links** - Always verify that your shortened links work correctly
2. **Use descriptive SEO metadata** - Help users understand where the link leads
3. **Set appropriate expiration dates** - Don't create permanent links for temporary content
4. **Monitor analytics** - Check click data to understand link performance

### For Link Users

1. **Be cautious with unknown links** - Shortened URLs can hide malicious destinations
2. **Check link previews** - Many platforms show link previews with SEO metadata
3. **Report suspicious links** - If you encounter malicious shortened links, report them

## Notes

- All clicks are tracked automatically for analytics purposes
- Geographic and device information is collected for analytics
- The redirect happens server-side for better performance and SEO
- Rate limiting applies to link access (100 requests per hour per IP)
