## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Permanent Deletion

- **This action cannot be undone**
- The link will immediately become inaccessible
- All analytics data associated with the link will be permanently deleted
- SEO metadata will be permanently deleted

### Access Control

- You can only delete links that belong to your account
- Attempting to delete a link that doesn't exist will return a 404 error
- Attempting to delete another user's link will return a 404 error (for security)

### Impact on Existing Links

- Any existing bookmarks or shared links using this shortened URL will immediately stop working
- The shortened URL will return a 404 error for all future requests
- Consider updating any documentation or communications that reference this link before deletion

## Best Practices

1. **Verify the link ID** before deletion
2. **Export analytics data** if you need to keep historical information
3. **Update any references** to the link in your documentation or communications
4. **Consider archiving** instead of deletion if you might need the data later

## Alternative: Disable Instead of Delete

If you want to temporarily disable a link without permanent deletion, consider:

1. **Update the expiration** to a past date
2. **Update the URL** to point to a "link disabled" page
3. **Use the update endpoint** to modify the link behavior

This approach allows you to restore the link later if needed.
