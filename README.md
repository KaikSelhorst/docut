## About the Project

Docut is a customizable link platform that helps you build stronger digital connections. Create short URLs, generate QR codes â€” all with SEO-friendly titles and descriptions for richer previews on social platforms. Integrate easily using the backend SDK and manage everything from a clean dashboard.

### Why Docut

Sharing links is more than shortening a URL. Docut lets you control how links appear when shared (title, description, and preview), track engagement, create QR codes, and integrate the flow into your own services with the SDK.
